# 🎯 NumberQuest – Interactive JavaScript Game

A clean and interactive number guessing game built to strengthen core JavaScript fundamentals.

## 📖 Project Overview

**NumberQuest** is a lightweight, browser-based number guessing game built using modern **JavaScript (ES6+)**, **HTML5**, and **CSS3**.

The game generates a random number within a defined range. Users attempt to guess the number while receiving real-time feedback such as:

- 📈 Too High  
- 📉 Too Low  
- 🎉 Correct Guess  

The score dynamically updates based on user interaction, and a session-based high score system tracks performance.

This project focuses on:

- Clean logic implementation  
- Structured code organization  
- Responsive UI behavior  
- Practical DOM manipulation  

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure  
- **CSS3** – Responsive styling & layout  
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** – Core game logic  

## ✨ Core Features

- Random number generation  
- Real-time feedback system  
- Dynamic score tracking  
- Session-based high score memory  
- Game reset functionality  
- Interactive UI updates via DOM manipulation  

## 🎯 Key Concepts Demonstrated
